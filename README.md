Hello friends this time I came up with very useful PCB which is Home Automation PCB.

Yes arduino is widely used in DIY home automation projects. Many of makers used bread board or zero PCB for their project

But as home Automation is used or our home so things must be also looks good and professional.

You don't want to be there loss wires hanging in your house, so this PCB is best solution for home automation project.

Home automation is the automatic control of electronic devices in your home. These devices are connected to the Internet,

Which allows them to be controlled remotely. With home automation, devices can trigger one another so you donâ€™t have to control them manually via an app or voice assistant

You can place HC-05 BT module in the PCB so that you can remotely control the load in your house remotely.





# Component Used


1) Arduino Nano 
2) Header pins 
3) 5V Relay 
4) Lipo Battery 
5) Custom PCB
6) Screw Terminals

# Custom PCB

In this PCB we used Arduino Nano as a micro controller, and we have used 3 5V relays so that we can run AC load on to this PCB.

One HC O5 BT module is also there to provide BT Connectivity.
